Hello everyone and welcome to Data Science Tidbits! I am Paolo Dano, an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist.

I have been doing data science for a year, and I am continuously learning with different individual projects. This blog aims to be a site on the things I've learned and is learning, and I hope to be able to put here small tutorials on how to implement something, and also go over some simple personal projects that I am working on! Enjoy and happy learning!
