Hello everyone and welcome to Data Science without the Fluff! I am Paolo Dano, an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist.

Learning Data Science can be extremely hard especially with resources that have too much fluff within their code. With these resources, I aim to create a resource that would teach the same things without all of the fluff in the code. That way, people would learn how to code from scratch and get the most essential parts of the code before any kind of extension is done to make it more friendly. 

I aim to post something new every month, and I hope you look forward to my posts!
